# Probability Distributions

```{r}
med.1000 <- read.table('ocean_temps', header = TRUE)

good <- abs ( med.1000$lon + 20 ) < 1 &
        abs ( med.1000$lat - 45 ) < 1

m <- mean ( med.1000$temp[good] )
s <- sqrt ( var ( med.1000$temp[good] ) )

par ( mfrow=c(2,1) )

hist ( med.1000$temp[good], xlab="temperature", ylab="",
main="", prob=T, xlim=c(5,11) )

lines ( density(med.1000$temp[good]) )
```

```{r}
hist ( discoveries, xlab="discoveries", ylab="", main="",
prob=T, breaks=seq(-.5,12.5,by=1) )
lines ( 0:12, dpois(0:12, 3.1), type="b" )
```

# The Rest

* The Binomial Distribution
* The Poisson Distribution
* The Exponential Distribution
* The Normal Distribution
* CENTERS, SPREADS, MEANS, AND MOMENTS
* Association, Dependence, Independence
